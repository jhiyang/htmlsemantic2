                                       As a young child, I faced unique challenges from the very beginning. Born with a cleft palate, my early years were marked by surgeries and medical interventions to address this condition. Despite these obstacles, I persevered, buoyed by the love and support of my family. Now, as a young adult embarking on my academic journey, I find myself facing new challenges and opportunities as a BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) student.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Starting out in IT was tough. I didn't feel confident in my skills and wondered if I'd made the right choice. The subjects seemed really hard, and I just couldn't get into them at first.
                                        But as time went on, things started to get better. I began to understand the topics more and even started to enjoy them. With help from my teachers and friends, I got the hang of programming languages and other technical stuff. I realized I really like solving problems and coming up with new ideas in IT. Each semester, I felt more confident and excited to learn more about this cool field.
            
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In the end, being a student of IT has been a journey of learning and growth for me. Even though I had doubts at first, I've found a passion for IT. I'm grateful for the support I've received, and I'm excited to see where this path takes me.

                                    <p>One of my hobbies is dancing. Dancing makes me feel good and happy. I love to dance in a way that I want to explore more about the various genres of dancing such as modern dance, ballet, contemporary and all.  </p>

                                        I also love to listen to music depending on my mood. If I feel happy, then I listen to music that energizes me and makes me want to dance! When I feel sad, I prefer listening to mellow yet heartwarming music. However, I don't enjoy listening to rock and metal music; it's just not my preference.

                                        I love watching videos, especially those related to crafting and dancing. When it comes to dancing, I primarily learn from YouTube, particularly in the realm of K-pop. And when it comes to crafting, I usually opt for DIY videos to learn and apply various techniques

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">One of my hobbies is dancing. Dancing makes me feel good and happy. I love to dance in a way that I want to explore more about the various genres of dancing such as modern dance, ballet, contemporary and all.  </p>

                            I also love to listen to music depending on my mood. If I feel happy, then I listen to music that energizes me and makes me want to dance! When I feel sad, I prefer listening to mellow yet heartwarming music. However, I don't enjoy listening to rock and metal music; it's just not my preference.

                            I love watching videos, especially those related to crafting and dancing. When it comes to dancing, I primarily learn from YouTube, particularly in the realm of K-pop. And when it comes to crafting, I usually opt for DIY videos to learn and apply various techniques
